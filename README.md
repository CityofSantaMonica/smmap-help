### First, choose a layer theme

SM MAP is offered in a variety of flavors with different layers and functionalities included in each. Begin by picking a relevant layer theme from the [SM MAP launch page.](https://csmgis01.smgov.net/splash/index.html)

> Do you always select the same layer theme? Create a browser bookmark to your preferred layer theme for quick and easy access. 

Change your mind? You can easily switch between the Essentials, Public Works, and Permits layer themes with the layer theme drop-down selector (shown below). SM MAP Mailing Labels is a dedicated application for generating mailing labels and may also be accessed from the [SM MAP launch page.](https://csmgis01.smgov.net/splash/index.html)

### Move around the map area

You can move around SM MAP much like how you would on Google Maps. 

**To zoom in**, scroll up with your mouse or double-click on the map. You can also click the zoom in button. 

**To zoom out**, scroll down with your mouse or click the zoom out button. 

**To pan** around the map area, simply click and drag anywhere on the map. If another tool is currently activated, you can also reactivate the panning functionality by clicking the Pan button in the toolbar. ![pan button](https://csmgis01.smgov.net/splash/pan.png)

### Search for an address or place
You can search by address or common place name (e.g. 1901 Main St or Montana Library). Search results display on the left sidebar. Select the search result to zoom to that feature.

### Turn layers on and off
The layer list is displayed on the left sidebar when SM MAP initially loads. Most layers live in layer groups which are collapsible folders. Use the plus button next to a layer group to expand or collapse the group. Use the check-boxes to turn layers on and off. 

> Some layers are not visible until you zoom into the map area. This helps keep the map less cluttered and perform better. You can tell if a layer isn't drawing when the layer name is formatted using grey italics. Simply zoom into the map area until the layer begins to draw.

Here is an example of a layer that is currently hidden because the map isn't zoomed in far enough. Zooming into the map activates the layer.

### Change the basemap

The City pays for high quality aerial imagery that is captured from an airplane on an annual basis. You can toggle this imagery on and off using the  basemap switcher in the lower-left of the map area. 

Looking for street labels after switching to the aerial basemap? Just check the box next to "Street Names (for aerial)" in the Layer List

### Find data on the map
There are a variety of ways to identify features on the map. First, you'll want to make sure that you've turned on any relevant layers from the Layer List. 

#### Find data using Map Tips
You can interact with most layers just by clicking their features on the map area. This opens a Map Tips window with additional information about the selected feature.

Sometimes you might click somewhere on the map where there is data from more than one layer. An example of this is shown in the image below. You can switch between Map Tips by clicking the arrows at the top of the Map Tips window or by changing the selected layer from the dropdown box.

#### Find data using the Identify tool
The Identify tool is useful for identifying data within a specific area on the map. Activate the Identify tool from the *Navigation* section of the toolbar. ![identify tool](https://csmgis01.smgov.net/splash/identify.png)

Once the Identify tool is activated, click or tap a location on the map to learn what's there. Or, click and drag on the map to draw a box around the area you want to identify. Learn more about the [SM MAP Toolbar]().
